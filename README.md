# Task_2
# Full Agentic Project

Welcome to the **Full Agentic Project** â€“ a structured and modular implementation of agent-based AI workflows using Python. This project is designed to demonstrate core concepts such as API communication, modular architecture, and intelligent task delegation using agents.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains a multi-part agentic system structured into several directories, each representing a different approach or module:

### ðŸ”¹ `01_uv`
- This module demonstrates a basic agent interaction using [UVicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) for asynchronous API serving.

### ðŸ”¹ `02_openrouter`
- Integrates with [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) for flexible LLM routing across multiple model providers.

### ðŸ”¹ `03_litellm_openai_agent/project_chatbot`
- A chatbot project powered by `LiteLLM` and OpenAI's API. Includes intelligent task execution and streaming response handling.

### ðŸ”¹ `hello_agent`
- A lightweight prototype agent example to help understand the core loop of an agent's behavior.
